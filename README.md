# Analysis Chart Front-End Challenge

The challenge is to implement an analytics dashboard like this one with the description below:

![design](https://github.com/abdelrhman-arnos/analysis-fe-challenge/blob/master/chart-design.jpg?raw=true)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A loading screen is expected while fetching the `data.json` from the server. You can use the `raw` file directly from Github or serve it from a local server.
- [ ] The 3 drop-down lists at the top should filter the data. `Select School` should have the option to `Show all`.
- [ ] A chart renders the data of the selected schools similar to the image above.
- [ ] On the right of the screen, the total number of lessons is displayed for the selected Camp, School, and Country, followed by a list of the schools with how many lessons each offers.
- [ ] The school's list from **point 4** should include toggles to show or hide the line chart of a certain school.
- [ ] Upon clicking on a point in the chart from **point 3**, the app should navigate to another page where all the details of that item are shown. No UX is provided, but use a simple layout that shows: like country, camp, school, month, and a number of lessons.
- [ ] After coming back from the details page implemented in **point 6**, the last filtering state should be preserved.

## Requirements

### Application Setup

- Use React, TypeScript, and Chart.js *(Next.js if needed)*
- Favor the use of React Functional Components over Class-based components.
- Set up a project structure that promotes scalability.
  - Source code is kept separate from compiled code.
  - **All tests should be contained in their own folder.**
  - Separate modules are created for any processing.
- Set up an npm project
  - `Package.json` should contain both devDependencies, and dependencies.
  - Scripts should be created for ==testing, linting/prettier, starting the server, and compiling TS.==
  - ==Build script== should run without error.

### Architecture

- Store the data by state-management of your choice ane make sure
  - The store is the applicationâ€™s source of truth.
  - Components read the necessary state from the store; they do not have their own versions of the same state.
  - Most application state is managed by the Redux store. State-based props are mapped from the store rather than stored as component state.
- The code is structured and organized in a logical way.
- Components are modular and reusable.

### Code Quality

- Write unit tests and make sure that ==test script== runs and all tests created pass, every component must have one test associated with it to pass.
- Utilize **TypeScript** to avoid errors and improve maintainability
  - All code in the SRC folder should use the `.ts` filetype.
  - Functions should include typed parameters and return types and not use the `any` type.
  - Build script should successfully compile TS to JS.
- Prettier and Lint scripts should run without producing any error messages.

## Suggestions to Make Your Project Stand Out

- [ ] Implement a toggle to switch on/off dark mode.
- [ ] Multi-lingual support.
- [ ] E2E testing
